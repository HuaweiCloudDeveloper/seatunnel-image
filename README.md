## Repository Introduction
[SeaTunnel](https://github.com/apache/seatunnel) is an easy-to-use, ultra-high-performance distributed data integration platform supporting real-time massive data synchronization.

**Why SeaTunnel?**  
SeaTunnel focuses on data integration and synchronization, addressing common challenges in the field:
- **Diverse Data Sources:** Hundreds of data sources with version incompatibilities. New sources emerge continuously, making it difficult for users to find a tool that comprehensively and quickly supports them.
- **Complex Synchronization Scenarios:** Requires support for offline full synchronization, offline incremental synchronization, CDC, real-time synchronization, full database synchronization, and more.
- **High Resource Requirements:** Existing tools often demand significant computing or JDBC connection resources for real-time synchronization of massive small tables, increasing enterprise burdens.
- **Lack of Quality and Monitoring:** Data loss or duplication frequently occurs during integration and synchronization. Monitoring is inadequate, making it hard to visualize real-time data status.
- **Complex Technology Stacks:** Enterprises use diverse technical components, necessitating custom synchronization programs for each, complicating development.
- **Difficult Management and Maintenance:** Offline and real-time synchronization often rely on different underlying technologies (Flink/Spark), requiring separate development and management.
